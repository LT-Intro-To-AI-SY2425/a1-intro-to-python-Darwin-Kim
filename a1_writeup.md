# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

This isn't my first time working with Python, so it feels familiar and relatively easy to work with. however, I'm still working on optomization, and doing things in ways that are more efficient

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

N/A

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?



I have learned a few functions that have helped me to work better and more efficiently within Python. The list() function was not someting I was aware of before, and it allowed me to make lists out of phrases much more easily. 

For example, if I wanted to list the letters of the alphabet, I could type:
-
alphabet="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
alphabet=list(alphabet)
-
instead of: 
-
list=["a", "b", "c", etc...].
